# tla_tf



This is an implementation of TLA from:
    [Metric Learning for Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00900.pdf)

The loss is built so that the network has a single input. A batch of clean images and their adversaries is passed to the network in the form:
    [X<sub>1</sub>  X<sub>2</sub>  X<sub>3</sub>...  X<sub>n</sub>  X'<sub>1</sub> X'<sub>2</sub> X'<sub>3</sub>... X'<sub>n</sub>] where X'<sub>i</sub> is the adversarially crafted from X<sub>i</sub>

The positive and anchor images are chosen from the clean and adversarial images respectively. The negative is chosen through a hard mining process where the nearest image of a diffent class is chosen.

Things to be aware of:
- The batch must be flattened before being passed to the loss
- The dimensions of the tla labels must be (batch_size, 1)
- An external loss function must be used as a wrapper to average the losses across the batch
